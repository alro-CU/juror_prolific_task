      <p>You are being asked to take part in a research study at Duke University to study how people make decisions. This study is being sponsored by grants from the National Institutes of Health and by institutional funds of Duke University. </p>
        <p>To decide whether or not you wish to participate, you should know enough about its risks and benefits to make an informed judgment. This consent form gives you information about the research study, and the experimenter will provide you with additional information about the specific decisions that you will be making. You can choose not to participate, and you can choose to end your participation at any time during the study. </p>
        <p>WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?<br>
          The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about how juries make decisions.</p>
        <p>WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?<br>
          In this study, you will make a series of decisions. You may also evaluate a series of scenarios using various ratings for intentionality and other measures. Some of the decisions may involve how you feel about certain people in a story. You may be asked to compare different characteristics and weigh their importance for a jury. There are no right or wrong answers in these decisions--you are free to choose whatever best matches your opinions, personal beliefs, or preferences. </p>
        <p>The experiment will be conducted on a computer, and your decisions will be recorded using a mouse and keyboard. During the experiment, you will be presented with questions asking about attitudes or preferences related to decision making. The questionnaires may ask for some personal or sensitive information, and if you do not wish to answer any question you are not obligated to do so. </p>
        <p>ARE THERE ANY POTENTIAL TRIGGER TOPICS?<br>
          Some of the stories in this experiment may involve the possibility of an imaginary crime. Some of these crimes are more or less serious than others. A few may involve homicide or sexual assault. There are no graphic details in any of the stories, and all of the stories discuss the matter in a factual manner. </p>
        <p>HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?<br>
          Your participation in this study will last for no more than 1 hour. You may choose to end your participation at any time. In order to receive compensation, however, you must complete the entire survey. </p>
        <p>WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?<br>
          There are no health risks associated with this study. None of the stimuli used in this experiment are threatening, offensive, or stressful to an average person. In order to protect your confidentiality, your data will be kept on password-protected computers and in locked file cabinets, each of which will only be accessible to investigators on this project. Your data will be coded by an arbitrary subject number that is stored separately from the consent form. This information will never be connected to your study data. </p>
        <p>ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?<br>
          This research study will provide you no direct benefit beyond what you were told about in the Mechanical Turk task description. In addition, the data you provide may help improve the scientific understanding of how people make decisions.</p>
        <p>WHAT ABOUT COMPENSATION?<br>
          You will be paid $<u>  </u> upon successful completion of the task. If you begin, but do not complete the task, you will be paid $<u>  </u>.</p>
        <p>NOTICE FOR DUKE EMPLOYEES:<br>
          If you are currently an employee of Duke University or Duke University Health Systems, you must provide your Duke UniqueID number to the experimenter in order to recieve payment. Your UniqueID will <i>not</i> be linked to any responses you give during this survey.</p>
        <p>WHO TO CONTACT WITH QUESTIONS? <br>
          If you have questions about this research, you may contact the responsible investigator, Dr. Pate Skene (Duke University Professor), at skene@neuro.duke.edu.</p>
        <p>STATEMENT OF CONSENT<br>
  &quot;The purpose of this study, procedures to be followed, and risks and benefits have been explained to me. I have been given an opportunity to ask questions, and my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. I have been told whom to contact if I have additional questions. I have read this consent form and agree to be in this study, with the understanding that I may withdraw at any time.&quot;</p>
