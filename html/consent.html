      <p>Purpose of the Study<br>
      <p>You are being asked to take part in a research study at University of Colorado Boulder to study how people make decisions. The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about how juries make decisions. We expect about 85 people will be in this research study. 
Your participation in this study will take approximately 30 minutes. You may choose to end your participation at any time. In order to receive compensation, however, you must complete the entire survey.
</p>
        <p>Explanation of Procedures<br>
          In this study, you will make a series of decisions.
					You may also evaluate a series of scenarios using various ratings for case strength and other measures.
					 Some of the decisions may involve how you feel about certain people in a story.
					  You may be asked to compare different characteristics and weigh their importance for a jury.
						 There are no right or wrong answers in these decisions --
						 you are free to choose whatever best matches your opinions, personal beliefs, or preferences. </p>
        <p>The experiment will be conducted on a computer, and your decisions will be recorded using a mouse and keyboard.
					During the experiment, you will be presented with questions asking about attitudes or preferences related to decision making.
					 The questionnaires may ask for some personal or sensitive information,
					 and if you do not wish to answer any question you are not obligated to do so. </p>
        
          <p>Some of the stories in this experiment may involve the possibility of an imaginary crime.
					 Some of these crimes are more or less serious than others. A few may involve homicide or sexual assault.
					  There are no graphic details in any of the stories, and all of the stories discuss the matter in a factual manner. </p>
        <p>Voluntary Participation and withdrawal<br>
          Whether or not you take part in this research is your choice. You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you.</p>

<p>During the task, you will be periodically asked simple comprehension questions regarding the scenarios you read. If you answer more than three of these incorrectly, the survey will end and you will be automatically withdrawn from the study. Data from participants who either choose to withdraw or are withdrawn as a result of answering the comprehension questions incorrectly will be discarded. 
</p>
        <p>Risks and Discomforts<br>
          There are no health risks associated with this study. None of the stimuli used in this experiment are threatening, offensive, or stressful to an average person.

 </p>
        <p>Confidentiality<br>
          Information obtained about you for this study will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law.
